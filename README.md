# Generic Sign-Up Page

**Design & SVGs by Ali Spittel using Sketch.**

**Coded by Stacie Taylor-Cima using HTML, CSS, SVGs, Google Fonts.**

**Why:** I follow a rock-star coder on Twitter. Her name is Ali Spittel - follow her @Ali Spittel! On 2/9/2018 Ali posted a design for a sign-up page as part of a design challenge she was taking part in. I was really inspired by the design and wanted to challenge myself to code it. Here is the result (in progress)!
